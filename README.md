# Blackjack Simulation on Basys 3 FPGA Board

## Overview

This project implements a simplified game of blackjack on the Basys 3 FPGA board. The game utilizes Multisim design files to create a circuit that represents the game logic. The player interacts with the game through button presses, and the results are displayed using LED indicators.

## Features

- Numerical representation of the user's and dealer's hands using binary LEDs.
- User input through button presses for "hit" or "stand."
- Autonomous decision-making for the dealer's moves.
- LED display indicating the outcome as a binary representation of win or lose.

## Note

This project is a primitive implementation for educational purposes.
